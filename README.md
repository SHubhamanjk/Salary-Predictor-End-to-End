# Salary Predictor

## Overview
Salary Predictor is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts salaries based on factors like experience, education, and job title. The project integrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, ensuring automated data preprocessing, model training, and deployment for seamless predictions. Additionally, a chatbot has been integrated to assist users with career-related queries and provide career guidance.

## Features
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Automates data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses deep learning (ANN) for accurate salary predictions.
- **Web Integration**: A user-friendly interface to input job-related details and get real-time salary predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
- **Model Deployment**: Hosted on a render using Flask.
- **Career Chatbot**: Provides career guidance, answers job-related queries, and helps users make informed career decisions.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Streamlit / Flask with integrated ML model
- **Chatbot**: NLP-based chatbot for career guidance

## End-to-End Pipeline
The project follows a complete ML pipeline:
1. **Data Collection**: Manual dataset collection.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features for better model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Training an artificial neural network (ANN) model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing accuracy and optimizing hyperparameters.
6. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model on a web server.
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Updating the model with new data periodically.
